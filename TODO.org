* TODO Some or all of these (need to think about the details):
** TODO Option to exclude nodes whose dependers are excluded
*** (these will be project nodes)
** TODO Option to exclude nodes that have no dependers or dependees
* TODO Bug: If there are namespaces x.y and x.y.z
** If x.y is a depender, it gets displayed with an internal name
*** Done -- but needs tests
** If x.y is a dependee, it gets displayed with an internal name
*** Done -- but needs tests
